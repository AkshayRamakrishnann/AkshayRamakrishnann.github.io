        <p>
          I’m <strong>Akshay Bhuvaneswari Ramakrishnan</strong>, a Data Scientist and former Research Associate in the Laboratory of Computational Intensive Care Medicine (LCICM) at Johns Hopkins University’s Whiting School of Engineering. My work applies AI, machine learning, and statistical modeling to improve patient outcomes in critical care. As an Intel Innovator, Intel-Certified ML Instructor, and Certified MLOps Professional, I specialize in deploying and scaling robust ML systems. I’ve authored two books, edited three more, published 13 Scopus-indexed papers (including two SCI journals), and presented at four international conferences. I’ve participated in five faculty development programs, led two corporate training sessions, and facilitated over 70 workshops. With prior industry experience as a Data Engineer at Hitachi Energy, I bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world implementation.
